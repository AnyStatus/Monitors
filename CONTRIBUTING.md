# Contribution Guidelines

> This document is a work in progress.

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to AnyStatus and its plugins, which are hosted on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AnyStatus.Monitors/) and built on AppVeyor. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.
